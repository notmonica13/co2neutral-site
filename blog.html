          <h2 class="post-title">Why the Cheapest Injection Molding Quote May Cost You More</h2>
          <p class="post-date">05.09.2025</p>
          <p>In supplier negotiations, many companies focus only on piece price. But in plastic injection molding, the real cost isn’t just what’s on the invoice — it’s the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).</p>
          <h3>Total Cost of Ownership in Injection Molding</h3>
          <p>TCO means looking at all cost drivers across the lifecycle of a part:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Tooling: upfront investment, maintenance, and expected life.</li>
            <li>Production: cycle time, scrap rates, energy use.</li>
            <li>Logistics: lead times, freight, and customs.</li>
            <li>Payment terms: how quickly you pay (or get paid).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>A mold that seems “cheap” can become expensive if it wears out early, generates higher scrap, or locks you into costly logistics. Likewise, a higher tooling price might be smarter if it guarantees efficiency and durability.</p>
          <h3>The Hidden Impact of Payment Terms</h3>
          <p>Suppliers often propose different payment terms — 30, 60, or even 120 days. On paper, longer terms look like free financing. In reality, they have a time value of money (TVM) cost.</p>
          <p>Example: Paying €1,000,000 today vs. in 90 days is not the same. If your company’s cost of capital is 8%, then delaying payment 90 days “saves” about €20,000 in financial value. On the flip side, accepting unfavorable terms (like prepayments) ties up capital that could have generated returns elsewhere.</p>
          <h3>How to calculate it (simplified)</h3>
          <figure>
            <img src="images/fv-formula.png" alt="Future Value formula" class="blog-formula" />
          </figure>
          <p>The formula above shows that the future value depends on the present value, the annual interest rate (<em>r</em>) and the days of payment delay (<em>t</em>). By quantifying this, purchasing teams can compare offers not only by price but also by financial impact.</p>
          <h3>Why This Matters?</h3>
          <p>OEMs push hard on target costs, but failing to account for TCO and TVM often leads to hidden losses:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A low-price supplier with poor payment terms may actually cost more.</li>
            <li>A higher quote with favourable terms could free capital and improve cash flow.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Negotiations focused on TCO instead of unit price shift the discussion toward value, not just cost cutting.</p>
          <h3>Closing Thought</h3>
          <p>The smartest buyers don’t ask “What’s the cheapest quote?” — they ask “What’s the most cost-efficient over time?”. Integrating TCO and TVM into supplier negotiations ensures decisions support both profitability and resilience.</p>

  <h2 class="post-title">Automotive Cost Engineering: Designing to Cost for Competitive Advantage</h2>
  <p class="post-date">08.09.2025</p>
  <p>Automotive manufacturers operate in a market where material costs, supply chains and sustainability targets are constantly changing. Cost engineering – the practice of engineering products to meet pre‑defined cost requirements – provides a structured way to control costs without compromising quality. Chris Domanski, a cost engineer with more than 25 years of experience in the automotive industry, explains that cost engineering combines methodologies such as target costing, cost estimating, should‑costing and value engineering to design and manufacture parts to specific cost targets【56019220039651†L454-L489】【56019220039651†L500-L527】.</p>
  <h3>Why automotive companies need cost engineering</h3>
  <p>Domanski notes that companies often believe they have cost‑engineering capabilities when in fact they only perform cost estimating【56019220039651†L500-L527】. True cost engineering goes beyond quoting and examines every cost driver:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Target costing sets cost targets for each component – a practice pioneered by Japanese car makers – and uses continuous improvement (kaizen) to meet or beat those targets【56019220039651†L533-L549】.</li>
    <li>Should‑costing and cost modelling build costs from the bottom up, estimating raw materials, purchased components, labour, overheads and tooling rather than relying on supplier quotes【56019220039651†L580-L584】.</li>
    <li>Value engineering (VA/VE) challenges design features that add cost but little customer value, ensuring that components meet functional requirements at minimum cost【56019220039651†L533-L553】.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For an automotive company, the ability to accurately estimate each supplier’s cost to produce components and the company’s own cost to assemble the vehicle is critical when setting cost targets【56019220039651†L580-L584】. Domanski’s experience across Ford, Continental, TRW and other OEMs shows that such data‑driven costing enables fact‑based negotiations and prevents overpaying for parts【56019220039651†L454-L489】.</p>
  <h3>Connecting cost engineering to injection moulding</h3>
  <p>Injection‑moulded plastics are ubiquitous in vehicles – from instrument panels to air‑intake manifolds. The process uses moulds and molten polymers to create complex shapes and internal cavities; advanced techniques like fusible‑core moulding enable hollow structures such as intake manifolds and brake housings【753864996288630†screenshot】. In injection moulding, tooling represents a major cost: automotive programmes often require thousands of moulds costing tens of millions of euros each year【296027719082906†L245-L255】. Applying cost‑engineering principles helps teams:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Estimate tooling, material, labour and overhead costs using should‑cost models rather than supplier quotes.</li>
    <li>Set cost targets for each mould and plastic part and drive design‑to‑cost decisions (e.g., simplifying geometry or combining parts to reduce mould count).</li>
    <li>Use VA/VE to challenge unnecessary features that increase cycle time or scrap rates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Effective cost engineering turns cost data into actionable insights, enabling automotive OEMs to deliver high‑quality products at competitive prices while meeting sustainability goals.</p>
